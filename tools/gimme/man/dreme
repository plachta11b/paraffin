USAGE:
    /usr/local/bin/dreme-py3 [options]

    -o  <directory>         create the specified output directory
                            and write all output to files in that directory
    -oc <directory>         create the specified output directory
                            overwritting it if it already exists;
                            default: create dreme_out in the currrent
                            working directory
    -p <filename>           positive sequence file name (required)
    -n <filename>           negative sequence file name (optional);
                            default: the positive sequences are shuffled
                            to create the negative set if -n is not used
    -dna                    use the standard DNA alphabet; this is the default
    -rna                    use the standard RNA alphabet
    -protein                use the standard Protein alphabet (may not work well)
    -alph <filename>        use custom alphabet (some restrictions apply - see manual)
    -norc                   search given strand only for motifs (not reverse complement)
    -e <ethresh>            stop if motif E-value > <ethresh>;
                            default: 0.05
    -m <m>                  stop if <m> motifs have been output;
                            default: only stop at E-value threshold
    -t <seconds>            stop if the specified time has elapsed;
                            default: only stop at E-value threshold
    -g <ngen>               number of REs to generalize; default: 100
                            Hint: Increasing <ngen> will make the motif
                            search more thoroughly at some cost in speed.
    -s <seed>               seed for shuffling sequences; ignored
                            if -n <filename> given; default: 1
    -verbosity <verbosity>  1..5 for varying degrees of extra output
                            default: 2
    -png                    create PNG logos
    -eps                    create EPS logos
    -desc <description>     store the description in the output;
                            default: no description
    -dfile <filename>       acts like -desc but reads the description from
                            the specified file; allows characters that would
                            otherwise have to be escaped;
                            default: no description
    -h                      print this usage message

-----------------------Setting Core Motif Width---------------------------------
                   Hint: The defaults are pretty good; making k larger
                         than 8 slows DREME down with little other effect.
                         Use these if you just want motifs shorter than 8.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    -mink <mink>            minimum width of core motif; default 3
    -maxk <maxk>            maximum width of core motif; default 8
    -k <k>                  sets mink=maxk=<k>

    DREME Finds discriminative regular expressions in two sets of DNA
    sequences.  It can also find motifs in a single set of DNA sequences,
    in which case it uses a dinucleotide shuffled version of the first
    set of sequences as the second set.

    DNA IUPAC letters in sequences are converted to N, except U-->T.

    IMPORTANT: If a negative sequence file is given, the sequences
    in it should have exactly the same length distribution as the
    sequences in the positive sequence file.  (E.g., all sequences
    in both files could have the same length, or each sequence in
    the positive file could have exactly N corresponding sequences with
    the same length as it in in the negative file.)
    Failure to insure this will cause DREME to fail to find motifs or
    to report inaccurate E-values.
